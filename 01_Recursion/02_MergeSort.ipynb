    "At a high level, mergesort applies the three steps of divide and conquer to sort a list of numbers:\n",
    "1. Divide: Split the list into two (approximately) equally sized lists.\n",
    "2. Conquer: Sort each of the two lists separately (using mergesort itself!).\n",
    "3. Combine: Given two sorted lists of approximately the same size, merge them into one big sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as a recursive call, Conquer is the only step that would require it. We know from the problem statement that the conquer step is sorting the two separated lists after they're divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mergesort has two steps: merging and sorting. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to merge and sort a list.\n",
    "- Mergesort runs in a guaranteed $O(nlogn)$ time, which is significantly faster than the average- and worst-case running times of several other sorting algorithms.\n",
    "    - The reason that its more time efficient that linear times is that it will be able to compute a sorted list in different segments rather that individually going through a list.\n",
